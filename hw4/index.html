		<h2>Overview</h2>
		Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.

		<h2>Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
		Here we use a model that uses a system of point masses and springs to create our simulation.

		<p>Here are a few views of pinned2.json</p>
		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>

		<p>These are what the wireframe looks like: (1) without any shearing constraints, (2) with only shearing constraints, and (3) with all constraints.</p>

			  </tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		<p>With a very low ks, there is no “bounce” to the cloth at all. This is likely due to the spring_length constraint that prevents the cloth from stretching beyond 10% of its resting length. The cloth settles very quickly into its resting position. In contrast, with a very high ks, it can be difficult for the cloth to go to rest if it does at all. The cloth vibrates very intensely due to the large forces created by the spring forces.</p>

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
			  <tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
				  <img src="images/part 2/Low Density.png" width="400px"/>
				  <figcaption>Low density cloth.</figcaption>

				<td style="text-align: center;">

				  <figcaption>High density cloth.</figcaption>

		</div>

		<p>Changing density affects the role spring forces and gravity plays on the cloth. With a low density, gravitational forces are close to 0 and so the cloth barely sags at all in the final resting position. As a result, the cloth almost looks like a vertical rectangle in this case. With a much higher density, the cloth sag is more prominent due to the additional gravitational force, though this sag is still limited likely by the max spring length constraint.</p>

		<p>Damping affects how the cloth “falls” from its initial starting state. With a high damping, it takes much longer for the cloth to fall as if the cloth was being slowed from falling by a big blanket of air. With a low damping, the cloth tends to swing back and forth more before finally settling down into its resting state.</p>

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		<p>To check for sphere collision, I first calculate the distance of a point on the cloth and the center of the sphere. If this distance is less than the radius of the sphere, I apply a correction to put the point on the surface where it would have “stopped falling.”</p>
		<p>As the spring coefficient increases from 500 to 5000 to 50000, the cloth maintains more of its rectangular shape and is thus less “draped” around the sphere as compared to its lower ks counterparts.</p>

		<p>To check for plane collision, I first take the last_position of a point and the new position where the point wants to go. I subtract the given point on the plane from those two positions and calculate the dot product of those differences with the given normal vector of the plane. If these two dot products don’t share the same sign, that means that the two positions are on different sides of the plane from one time frame to the next and so there must be a collision. I apply a correction to make sure that where the new position would cross the plane, the pointmass will not cross that point.</p>

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		<p>To handle self collisions, we rely on three functions: build_spatial_map, self_collide, and hash_position.

			hash_position takes in a position vector and we compute a unique hash number. We created this hash number using 3D partitions of space using the width, height, and thickness of the cloth and arbitrary numbers to multiply with them to make a unique number.
			
			build_spatial_map is used to create a map pairing the hash values of the point masses of the cloth with a vector of point masses near to each other.

			self_collide takes in a point mass and compares its distance between other points close to it and determines whether or not they are within 2 * thickness units of each other. If so, a correction vector is applied to the point mass to pull it away from the point it may collide with.
		</p>

		<p>Here are the stages of a cloth falling on itself.</p>

		<p>When we lower the density slider, the cloth becomes more stiff as it attempts to fold on itself. Any curve formed when it folds is very wide in nature as if it is hard to bend on itself. As we increase the density slider, the cloth feels more fluid-like. The folds feel more granular allowing smaller folds on itself and it makes the cloth look much more flexible than usual.</p>

		<p>Upon playing with the ks slider, we noticed that as we increased the slider, the cloth becomes a lot more bouncy, especially when it tries to go into a rest state. As the correction vectors are applied from self_collide, the vector position changes are very noticeable making the cloth move much more than usual.</p>
