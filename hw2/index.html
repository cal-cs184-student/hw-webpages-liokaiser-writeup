		<h2>Overview</h2>
		In this project, we implement methods of geometric modeling to create curves and 3D meshes visually. 
		We built Bezier curves and surfaces using de Casteljau algorithm, manipulate the triangles on a mesh using edge flip, split, and loop subdivisions.

		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		For each pair control points and using parameter \(t\) (for time), perform linear interpolation (lerp) to create another point between them. 
		If you do this with all pairs of points, if you have n points, then you should have n-1 points after the first run of de Casteljau’s algorithm. 
		Using these points, you can then connect them together with lines. This is the first run of de Casteljau’s algorithm. If you repeat recursively 
		until you only perform 1 lerp at the end, the you have evaluated the final point to draw the curve at that time \(t\). Perform this for all \(t\) until 
		the full curve is complete. 
		
		<br /> <br />

  		To implement this, I loop through all vector elements until the second to last and then performed a lerp on the current control point with the next point. I then pushed this new evaluated point into a vector of intermediate points and returned the new vector.

		<p>Here are images of a bezier curve being formed using de Casteljau algorithm at different steps of the process.</p>

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		A lot of the intuition behind de Casteljau’s algorithm can be applied to surfaces. 
		This time, we are given an nxn grid of control points consisting of Vector3D objects. 
		We need to perform a series of de Casteljau’s algorithm for each vector in the rows, 
		then we need to perform one final one in the other axis. Beginning again at the 2D 
		level, we perform de Casteljau’s algorithm until you evaluate a 1D point. When we go 
		down the rows, we want to use the u parameter to act as our t in our evaluate steps. 
		You want to store these in an n sized vector of Vector3D objects. Then we perform one 
		last evaluate step using the v parameter signifying we are performing linear interpolations 
		in the other axis/direction. We will then get a bezier mesh as a result.

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		In order to get the area-weighted normal around a vertex, I needed to sum the cross 
		product of the normal vectors of the faces touching the vertex. To accomplish this, 
		I iterated through the half edges originating from the vertex. At each step, I got 
		the vertex the half edge is pointing to. I then also get the half edge and vertex 
		of the next edge that is touching both the same vertex and face. Using these vertices, 
		I got the vectors of these edges by subtracting the vertex positions from the target 
		vertex. I then get the cross product of these vectors and add them to an overall sum 
		of these cross products. I iterate to each half edge until all of them have been travelled 
		to. Once I have the whole sum, I then normalize this vector to retrieve the final 
		area-weighted vertex normal.

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		The task of edge flipping simply involved the collection of the current half edge, vertices,
		edges, and faces. I used a diagram to visually see what elements each half edge is associated 
		with before and after the edge flip.

			<figcaption>Diagram utilized for edge flipping implementation.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		When I was initially implementing this function, I tried flipping edges but it would just leave 
		holes where the triangle originally was. I then realized I forgot to set neighbors for the outside 
		half edges. Then when I was flipping edges, the edge itself would flip but one of the triangles 
		that should be at the edge is still a hole. I then had to go back to my diagram to find out two 
		of my edge collection lines had the wrong half edge specified.

						<figcaption><code>dae/teapot.dae</code> after some edge flips.</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		I used the CMU figure provided for part 4 as a template to form my own diagram for which I could 
		much more easily tell which half edges had corresponding next half edge, twins, vertices, etc… 
		As a result, implementation of this part went smoothly without any major debugging required. 
		While the CMU guide was weird in that next half edges went clockwise instead of counterclockwise, 
		I figured that this wouldn’t be a problem as I could mirror every variable without changing the 
		instructions and now next half edges went around the correct way.

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		I mainly followed the provided steps in the comments of part 6 to the best of my ability. This required me 
		to make some changes to Split Edge as I needed to mark the newly created edges and vertices as new though 
		this is where I ran into a problem. In the after split pointer diagram for pt. 5, I assumed en0 is considered 
		a new edge, as after all, I created it. However, after a lot of tedious debugging with help from OH TAs, 
		they helped me recognize that even though I create a new edge in the mesh, it is still considered part of 
		the old edge and thus should not be considered a new edge.

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
				<tr>
					<td style="text-align: center;">

			</table>
		</div>
		<br/>
		After loop subdivision, we noticed that the sharp corners and edges would be smoothened out. 
		Because of this, the icosahedron would look similar to a sphere after multiple loop subdivisions.
		However, this effect can somewhat be reduced by presplitting edges before performing the usual loop subdivision.

		<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
			<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
				<tr>
				<td style="text-align: center;">
					<img src="./images/part6/6_presplit_1.png" width="400px"/>
					<figcaption>Icosahedron with splits applied manually before loop subdivision.</figcaption>

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>

		<br />
		Pre-splitting every face first before loop subdivision preserves the symmetry of the mesh afterwards. The asymmetry 
		occurs as a result of the asymmetry of the mesh which means that new vertices would be biased towards certain corners 
		more than others. By presplitting edges, there is no bias in the vertex location so the end result is also symmetrical.
